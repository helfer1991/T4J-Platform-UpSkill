# T4J Platform
* This project was developed on the UpSkill program context.
* The goal was to develop a fullstack application that would allow companies to register themselves, to publish job ads with given technical requirements in order to gather applications from freelancers (which could also register themselves on the platform).
* Essentially, this is a matching application, where freelancers, if they meet the minimal technical requirements, can apply to job ads and then they are allocated a given task. That allocation can be done either manually, or automatically.
* Technologies used: Spring, Java, SQL, PL/SQL, JavaFX.
* Final grade: 17/20.
